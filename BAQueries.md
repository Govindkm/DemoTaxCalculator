Sure, I can definitely help you in developing this web application. Here are the steps that we can follow:

Step 1: Understanding the project requirements
----------------------------------------------

As per your requirement, the web application should have the following features:

*   Ability for users to add their income details and deductions
*   Calculation of tax based on Indian income tax laws
*   A summary of the total tax amount that the user has to pay
*   The application should not store any user data

Step 2: Tech Stack
------------------

Based on the requirements, we can go for any web development frameworks such as ReactJS, AngularJS or VueJS. For the backend, we may use Python Flask or Django.

Step 3: Database Decisions
--------------------------

Since we don't need to store user data, we can avoid using databases like MySQL. Instead, we can use in-memory database engines like Redis, SQLite or simply work with JSON files.

Step 4: Indian Income Tax Laws
------------------------------

We need to study Indian income tax laws to understand how to calculate the tax amounts correctly. There are different slabs and rates depending on the income and age of the individual. Additionally, there are various deductions and exemptions available under different sections of the Income Tax Act.

Step 5: Development
-------------------

We can start by building a basic UI where users can enter their incomes and deductions. Then, we can implement the logic to calculate the tax amount based on the entered information. Finally, we can display the tax summary to the user.

Step 6: Deployment
------------------

Once we complete development and testing, we can deploy the web application on different platforms like Heroku or AWS. This will make it easy for users to access the application from anywhere.

Below is a simple high-level design for the envisioned system:

Give comparision of my income tax based on new regime and old regime. Create a user story for this requirement

ChatGPT
-------

As a user, I want to compare the income tax based on new regime and old regime, so that I can make an informed decision regarding which regime to choose while filing my taxes.

The user story can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  User logs in to the WebApp and navigates to the Income Tax Calculator section.
2.  User selects the option to 'Compare Regimes' from the available options.
3.  User is prompted to enter their income details (salary, allowances, deductions etc.) for both old and new regimes.
4.  The WebApp then calculates the total tax payable under both regimes and displays the comparison in a neat, easy-to-understand format.
5.  The user can then decide based on the comparison which regime they would like to choose while filing their taxes.
6.  If the user has any queries regarding the comparison, they can access the brief information provided by the WebApp to get a better understanding of the pros and cons of each regime.
7.  The user can then download or print the detailed computation sheet for future reference.
8.  Once the comparison is complete, the Application should not store any user data for privacy concerns.

Acceptance criteria for the given user story could be as follows:

1.  The WebApp should provide a secure login system where users can access their account using a password or any other authentication method.
2.  The application should verify that all income tax laws and regulations applicable to Indian users are correctly represented in the tool.
3.  Users should be able to enter their income details, allowances, deductions, etc. accurately and without data loss or corruption.
4.  The WebApp should show easy-to-understand side-by-side comparison tables for old and new tax regimes with clear indication of the final tax amount payable under both regimes.
5.  The Application must not store any personal identifiable information provided by the user after the comparison is complete.
6.  The web app should be mobile responsive and have an intuitive UI/UX design.
7.  The tax calculations should be accurate and appropriate.
8.  Appropriate error handling message about unsupported revenue configurations (if any), or invalid input requests, notifying that user about what went wrong.

These acceptance criteria will ensure that the WebApp delivers the expected functionality accurately and securely.
