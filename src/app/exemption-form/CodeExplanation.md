Sure, I can add comments to the given Angular component code as follows:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormControl, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-income-form', //Selector used to select this component in the parent component
  templateUrl: './income-form.component.html', //Location of the template file that is rendered when this component is used
  styleUrls: ['./income-form.component.css'] // Location of the stylesheet for styling the template file
})
export class IncomeFormComponent {

// Create a new instance of FormGroup to create a form with multiple FormControls 
  myForm = new FormGroup({

  //Create an individual form control to collect basicpay input, setting its initial value to 0,
  //setting it as required and ensuring user input should not be less than 1.
    basicpay: new FormControl(0, [
      Validators.required, 
      Validators.min(1)
    ]),

  //Create an individual form control to collect da(input) data with initial value of 0 meaning there's no allowance,
    da: new FormControl(0),

  //Create an individual form control to collect hra(input) data with initial value of 0,
    hra: new FormControl(0),

  //Create an individual form control to collect lta (Leave Travel Allowance) data with initial value of 0,
    lta: new FormControl(0),

  //Create an individual form control to collect cityallowance data with initial value of 0,
    cityallowance: new FormControl(0),

  //Create an individual form control to collect miscellaneous data with initial value of 0,
    miscellaneous: new FormControl(0),

  //Create an individual form control to collect monthlybonus data with initial value of 0,
    monthlybonus: new FormControl(0),

  //Create an individual form control to collect quaterlybonus data with initial value of 0,
    quaterlybonus: new FormControl(0),
    
  //Create an individual form control to collect annual bonus data with an initial value of 0,
    annualbonus: new FormControl(0)
  });

// Function executed upon submission of the form. Logs the form value object to console.
  submitForm() {
    console.log(this.myForm.value);
  }
}
```

The added comments provide a brief description about each part of the code, making it easy to understand and maintain the code.

Certainly, here's the code with comments that expand on the abbreviations:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormControl, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-income-form',
  templateUrl: './income-form.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./income-form.component.css']
})
export class IncomeFormComponent {
  // creating a new form group that contains different form controls for managing user input
  myForm = new FormGroup({
    // Basic Pay is required and should be at least 1
    basicpay: new FormControl(0, [
      Validators.required,
      Validators.min(1)
    ]),
    // Dearness Allowance
    da: new FormControl(0),
    // House Rent Allowance
    hra: new FormControl(0),
    // Leave Travel Allowance 
    lta: new FormControl(0),
    // City Allowance 
    cityallowance: new FormControl(0),
    // Miscellaneous Allowance
    miscellaneous: new FormControl(0),
    // Monthly Bonus 
    monthlybonus: new FormControl(0),
    // Quarterly Bonus
    quaterlybonus: new FormControl(0),
    // Annual Bonus
    annualbonus: new FormControl(0)
  });

  // This function gets executed whenever the form gets submitted
  submitForm() {
    // Here we are just logging the value of the form to the console (just for testing purposes)
    console.log(this.myForm.value);
  }
}
```
