I have been given user story to design a tax calculator webapp for indian consumers.

User Story: 
As a user, I want to compare the income tax based on new regime and old regime, so that I can make an informed decision regarding which regime to choose while filing my taxes. I expect the application to comply with all Indian laws related to taxation and provide me with a clear summary of the amount of tax I need to pay based on my entered details. The user story can be broken down into the following steps: User logs in to the WebApp. User is prompted to enter their income details (salary, allowances, deductions etc.) for both old and new regimes. The WebApp then calculates the total tax payable under both regimes and displays the comparison in a neat, easy-to-understand format. Once the comparison is complete, the Application should not store any user data for privacy concerns. Based on the above user story give me acceptance criteria.

These are the story points:

Acceptance criteria for the given user story could be as follows:

1.  User logs in to the WebApp and navigates to the Income Tax Calculator section.
2.  The application should verify that all income tax laws and regulations applicable to Indian users are correctly represented in the tool.
3.  Users should be able to enter their income details, allowances, deductions, etc. accurately and without data loss or corruption.
4.  The WebApp should show easy-to-understand side-by-side comparison tables for old and new tax regimes with clear indication of the final tax amount payable under both regimes.
5.  The Application must not store any personal identifiable information provided by the user after the comparison is complete.
6.  The web app should be mobile responsive and have an intuitive UI/UX design.
7.  The tax calculations should be accurate and appropriate.
8.  Appropriate error handling message about unsupported revenue configurations (if any), or invalid input requests, notifying that user about what went wrong.

These acceptance criteria will ensure that the WebApp delivers the expected functionality accurately and securely.

How can I start with this application design

What frameworks can I use for this. I want an easy fast UI and on backend I want calculations to be performed without errors. 

I do not want to use any database.

## Genie

There are several frameworks you can consider for this webapp, depending on your preferred programming language and expertise:

1. ReactJS: A popular and widely-used JavaScript library that allows you to build interactive and responsive user interfaces.

2. AngularJS: Another JavaScript framework that offers an easy-to-use UI with built-in security features and fast client-side rendering.

3. Flask: A Python-based microframework that is lightweight and easy-to-use, with built-in templating support.

4. Express.js: A Node.js-based web framework that offers a simple API for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

All of these frameworks can help you deliver a fast and intuitive UI/UX design as well as perform accurate tax calculations on the backend without the need for a database. It ultimately depends on your familiarity with the language and framework ecosystem, so choose one that best fits your skills and project requirements.

## You

I am familiar with Angular a bit I will be using that for UI. Shall I use backend apis to calculate taxes or I should use client side machine to calculate also?

## Genie

It is generally recommended to perform sensitive calculations like tax calculations on the server-side, rather than client-side. This is because server-side calculations are more secure as they cannot be manipulated by the user directly.

Therefore, I would recommend using backend APIs to calculate taxes for your WebApp. You can choose any web framework or language of your choice such as Node.js with Express, Ruby on Rails, Flask or Django in Python, etc., to create the backend APIs to handle the tax calculation logic. 

Your Angular UI can then make API requests to the backend to fetch the calculated tax details and display them to the user. By performing tax calculations on the server-side, you can ensure that your application is accurate, efficient, and secure.

Compare flask and nodejs express

## Genie

Both Flask and Node.js with Express are popular frameworks used for building web applications. Here are some comparisons between the two:

Architecture:
- Flask is a micro web framework, which means it provides only the basic functionalities required to build simple web applications. It is minimalistic and easy to use.
- Node.js with Express is an MVC (Model View Controller) framework that offers more advanced features like routing, middleware support, templating engines, etc.

Performance:
- Flask is built on Python and its performance is comparable to other Python frameworks.
- Node.js with Express is built on JavaScript and runs on the V8 engine, making it very fast and efficient.

Learning Curve:
- Flask has a simpler syntax and is relatively easier to learn, especially for developers who have experience with Python.
- Node.js with Express has a steeper learning curve due to its asynchronous programming model and the need to understand JavaScript concepts.

Scalability:
- Flask can be scaled up to handle larger applications, but it requires additional dependencies to do so.
- Node.js with Express is highly scalable and can easily handle large volumes of requests due to its non-blocking I/O.

Community Support and Ecosystem:
- Flask has a smaller community compared to Node.js with Express, but it still has a good number of libraries and packages available for developers.
- Node.js with Express has a very active community with a huge ecosystem of libraries, modules, and packages available for developers.

In conclusion, both Flask and Node.js with Express are great frameworks, and the choice depends on the project requirements, the developer's familiarity and preference, and the ecosystem around the languages.
